For the Brazilian case:

Obs1. It is common practice that tenants pay for condominium and property taxes. So the burden falls for either owner or tenant

Obs2. There is no income tax deduction for mortgage interest paid    

Obs3. Taxes of 15% apply both in cash gains as well as increase in home values
