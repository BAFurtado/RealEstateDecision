This is a simple numerical simulation that checks whether buying or renting is the best option, for a given set (of variable, uncertain) parameters.

For the Brazilian case:

Obs1. It is common practice that tenants pay for condominium and property taxes. So the burden falls for either owner or tenant

Obs2. There is no income tax deduction for mortgage interest paid    

Obs3. Taxes of 15% apply both in cash gains as well as increase in home values

Obs4. Years of payment plus age at signature cannot exceed 80 years. Thus, setting maximum age at 69
for contract day at 2019 and mortgage of maximum 30 years. Adjust accordingly.
